## ðŸŒŸ About Us

We are a collective of researchers, urban planners, and data scientists dedicated to improving urban environments using reproducible research practices. Our goal is to create accessible resources that empower communities and researchers alike.

MAIN IDEA is:
- to run a new tool;
- try to run it on some publicly accessible data (I encourage to use OSM in most cases);
- create small report / example on how it goes on several cities across the glob e.g. Saint-P, Delhi, Newcastle etc.;
